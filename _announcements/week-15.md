title: Week 15 Announcement
week: 15
date: 2022-11-25

For the last week of classes, make sure 
- to present _at least once_ (this is a quarter of your grade 
completely in your control) and 
- to turn in any revisions by the end of Friday Decemeber 2 
(all course materials can be found at our GitHub org) 

Each presentation after the first will convert your lowest 
homework or quiz to a 100%. 

I've sent out an assignment in Teams that just serves to 
report your current grade. 

For the final week, course time will be devoted entirely to 
revisions, project work, and presentations (though I 
encourage you to do the reading).
